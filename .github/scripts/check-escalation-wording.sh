# check-escalation-wording.sh — fail when an escalation failure count is
# restated outside the normative constitution and skills.
#
# The escalation ladder (tiers and failure budgets) is defined once, in
# `.agents/skills/session-orchestration/SKILL.md`; the verification skill's
# budget line and the retro skill's lesson-capture trigger mirror it by
# design. Every other Codex agent surface must defer to the ladder without
# restating its counts: duplicated numbers drift from the design authority.
#
# A violation is a line in a scanned surface that pairs a count word with an
# escalation word. Scanned surfaces are custom agents and every repository
# skill except the normative files below.
#
# Output: brief OK summary and exit 0 when clean; file:line:content listing
# and exit 1 on violation. Dependencies: bash 3.2+, grep, git only — runs
# identically in CI (.github/workflows/ci.yml, quality job) and on dev
# machines.
