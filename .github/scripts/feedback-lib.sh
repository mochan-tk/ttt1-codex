#!/usr/bin/env bash
# feedback-lib.sh — consent-gated adopter feedback helper.
#
# Sourced (never executed) by the interactive scaffold scripts — the
# installer and the setup-* set. When the sourcing script fails on an
# unguarded command in an interactive run, the exit path *offers* to file
# an upstream issue via the adopter's own `gh issue create`. Everything
# about the offer fails closed:
#
#   - fires only for unguarded failures (recorded by an ERR trap), never
#     for a script's own deliberate `exit` remediations, and never in CI
#     (`CI` / `GITHUB_ACTIONS` set) or non-interactive runs (stdin and
#     stderr must both be TTYs); gh must be installed;
#   - the filing target and scaffold version come exclusively from the
#     scaffold-version marker in SCAFFOLD-CHANGELOG.md (read contract at
#     the write site in scaffold-init.sh). No parseable marker with a
#     valid repo field means no offer — the target is never guessed;
#   - the payload is the fixed allowlist of
#     `.github/docs/adopter-feedback.md`: script name
#     (fixed enum below, never $0), failing line number (never
#     $BASH_COMMAND), exit code, uname -s/-m, bash/gh/jq versions, and the
#     marker sha. Every value is charset- and length-validated and must be
#     a single line; a value that fails validation is reported as
#     "unknown", never raw;
#   - nothing is sent without an explicit `y` on a previewed, exact body;
#     the default answer is no. Declining or any gate closing leaves the
#     failure path byte-identical to an unwired script, exit code intact.
#
# Entry point: feedback_arm <script-name>. The name must be one of the
# fixed enum (scaffold-init, setup-labels, setup-project, setup-ruleset,
# setup-sources); any other value leaves the script unarmed. Arming sets
# `set -o errtrace` (bash 3.2 does not fire ERR inside functions without
# it) and chains any pre-existing single-quoted EXIT trap — the
# installer's workdir cleanup — running it before the consent prompt so an
# interrupted prompt cannot leak temp state.
#
# No environment knobs: behavior cannot be altered from the environment
# (the ERR-seen state is re-initialized at arm time, and the marker is
# read only from SCAFFOLD-CHANGELOG.md in the current directory or at the
# git toplevel). The guard-test harness simulates a terminal by
# overriding the _fb_isatty function in its own fixture scripts after
# sourcing this file — a code-level seam unavailable to callers.
