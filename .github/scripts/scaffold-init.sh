#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scaffold-init.sh — install the agentic-dev scaffold into a repository.
#
# One-liner (run at the root of a new or existing git repository):
#   KIT_COMMIT="replace-with-reviewed-40-hex-commit"
#   curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mochan-tk/ttt1-codex/$KIT_COMMIT/.github/scripts/scaffold-init.sh" \
#     | SCAFFOLD_REF="$KIT_COMMIT" bash
# Windows (PowerShell): use the companion bootstrap scaffold-init.ps1 in this
# directory — it runs this script through Git Bash; logic lives here only.
#
# What it installs — and nothing else; the application owns every other path:
#   always            .github/**  .agents/**  .codex/agents/**
#                     .codex/config.toml  AGENTS.md  SCAFFOLD-CHANGELOG.md
#   seed-if-absent    .gitignore  .gitattributes
#   never             README.md, LICENSE, plugin/, .vscode/ (application
#                     identity/license and repository-only distribution
#                     artifacts belong to the adopting repository)
#
# Safety:
#   - collisions refuse by default: the run lists them and exits 1 with the
#     target untouched; --force overwrites exactly the listed collisions
#     (and reports each one); --dry-run prints the file plan and performs
#     no target-repository write — it does not even create the target
#     directory. A network-source dry-run may use a temporary download.
#   - --upgrade refreshes an adopted instance: colliding scaffold-owned
#     files (scripts, skills, custom agents, issue/PR templates, and
#     SCAFFOLD-CHANGELOG.md) are overwritten in place, while tuned
#     surfaces (.codex/config.toml, workflows/, CODEOWNERS, and AGENTS.md)
#     and instance knowledge (.github/docs/**)
#     are kept and reported; files the instance lacks are installed in
#     every class. Run it on a branch and land the result as one PR —
#     git review is the safety net for the refreshed files.
#   - symlinks are never written through: if an install path, or any
#     directory on the way to it, is a symbolic link, the run refuses —
#     --force does not override this. Writing through links could land
#     files outside the repository.
#   - network fetches are pinned: SCAFFOLD_REF is resolved to a commit SHA
#     first (gh when present, else git ls-remote), the tarball is fetched
#     at that SHA, and that SHA is what the provenance line in the
#     target's SCAFFOLD-CHANGELOG.md records. A machine-readable
#     scaffold-version marker is maintained alongside it (read contract
#     documented at the write site below).
#   - installed files are staged with `git add`, never committed.
#
# Environment:
#   SCAFFOLD_REPO        source template repository (default: mochan-tk/ttt1-codex)
#   SCAFFOLD_REF         branch / tag / SHA to fetch (default: main)
#   SCAFFOLD_SOURCE_DIR  local template tree to copy from — no network at all
#
# Usage: scaffold-init.sh [--force|--upgrade] [--dry-run] [--help] [target-dir]
#   target-dir  create the directory (git init if needed) and install there;
#               without it, install into the current directory's repo root.
# Exit codes: 0 ok · 1 collision/symlink/target error · 2 usage · 3 fetch error.

Usage: scaffold-init.sh [--force|--upgrade] [--dry-run] [--help] [target-dir]

Install the Agentic Dev Kit for Codex into a git repository (current
directory by default; pass target-dir to create/init one). Installs the
GitHub control plane, repo skills, Codex custom agents and portable config,
AGENTS.md, and SCAFFOLD-CHANGELOG.md; seeds .gitignore and .gitattributes only
when absent. It never installs the kit README, root LICENSE, editor settings,
the distributable plugin copy, or the optional Dev Container payload. Scoped
kit license and attribution notices under .github/docs/ are always included.

Flags:
  --force     overwrite colliding files (default: refuse and exit 1);
              never overrides the symlink refusal
  --upgrade   refresh an adopted scaffold: overwrite colliding
              scaffold-owned files (scripts, skills, custom agents,
              issue/PR templates, SCAFFOLD-CHANGELOG.md); keep tuned
              surfaces (.codex/config.toml, workflows/, CODEOWNERS,
              AGENTS.md) and .github/docs/** — every kept
              file is listed; absent files are installed in every class.
              Mutually exclusive with --force. Run on a branch and land
              the result as one PR.
  --dry-run   print the file plan; do not mutate or create the target repo
  --help      this text

Environment:
  SCAFFOLD_REPO        source repo, owner/name   (default mochan-tk/ttt1-codex)
  SCAFFOLD_REF         branch / tag / SHA        (default main)
  SCAFFOLD_SOURCE_DIR  local template tree — skips all network fetch

The network fetch is pinned: SCAFFOLD_REF is resolved to a commit SHA
before download, and that SHA is recorded in the provenance line.

Examples:
  KIT_COMMIT="replace-with-reviewed-40-hex-commit"
  curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mochan-tk/ttt1-codex/$KIT_COMMIT/.github/scripts/scaffold-init.sh" \
